I'm Alireza Mohammadi, a Research Assistant at IAU in Kermanshah, Iran. I like getting into creating advanced technology.

## About Me

ðŸŽ“ **Education:**  
I currently hold a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Islamic Azad University, Kermanshah Branch, with a CGPA of 3.5/4. My academic journey is driven by a passion for tackling complex problems and fostering innovation through technology.

ðŸ”¬ **Research & Academic Experience:**  
Since 2022, I have been actively engaged as a Research Assistant under the supervision of Dr. Fariborz Parandin.  My research contributions are focused on leveraging cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques to address critical challenges in two key areas:

* **AI for Science:**  My work in this domain involves applying advanced ML models, including CNNs, RNNs, FNNs, and meta-learning frameworks, to advance the field of next-generation computing.  Specifically, I am investigating the optimization of optical logic gates and exploring novel applications of photonic crystal technology â€“ crucial components for the development of ultra-fast and energy-efficient computing systems.

* **Cybersecurity:**  I am deeply committed to enhancing the security of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). My research focuses on developing sophisticated AI-driven methodologies to safeguard sensitive healthcare data and protect critical infrastructure from evolving cyber threats.

# My Publication Journey

My research output has shown consistent improvement over time, as evidenced by the increasing quality of the venues where my work is published.
